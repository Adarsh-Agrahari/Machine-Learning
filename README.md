## Want to Add Your Codes?

Contributions are always welcome! Clone this repository and add your work following the requirements mentioned below. Submit a Pull Request and if the work submitted is accurate, it will be made public.

### Requirements

- Create a `*.ipynb` file with all the codes that are done on a specific day in the laboratory.

- Run the cells and display the outputs in the `*.ipynb` file.

- Provide proper explanation about the code and the steps that are used in the notebook.

- Provide the additional boilerplate files like `*.csv` , `*.txt` or any kind of pre-requisite files if demanded by that particular notebook.

- Put all the files necessary for the notebook inside a folder with the name format as `DDMMYYYY` and submit a pull request.

### Feel free to contribute to this repository by

* Adding new notebooks or code examples for other machine learning algorithms.

* Improving existing code or documentation.

* Fixing any bugs or issues.
